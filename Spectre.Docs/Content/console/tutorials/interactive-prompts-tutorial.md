In this tutorial, we'll build a pizza ordering system that collects user input. By the end, you'll know how to ask for text, let users choose from lists, and confirm their selections.

## What We're Building

Here's what our pizza order flow will look like:

<Screenshot Src="/assets/interactive-prompt-tutorial.svg" Alt="Interactive Prompts Tutorial" />

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Basic C# knowledge
- Completion of the [Getting Started](xref:console-getting-started) tutorial

> [!CAUTION]
> Prompts are not thread safe. Using them together with other interactive components such as progress displays, status displays, or other prompts is not supported.

<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
**Ask for the Customer's Name**

Let's start by asking for the customer's name. The `Ask<string>()` method displays a prompt and waits for input:

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Examples/SpectreConsole/Tutorials/InteractivePromptsTutorial.cs > InteractivePromptsTutorial.AskCustomerName
```

Run the code:

```bash
dotnet run
```

"What's your name?" appears with a cursor waiting for input. Type your name and press Enter. The program then greets you by name.

See how we used `[green]` markup in the prompt? You can style your prompts just like any other Spectre.Console output.

You've captured your first user input.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
**Choose a Pizza Size**

Now let's let the user pick from a list of options. A `SelectionPrompt` shows an interactive menu where users navigate with arrow keys:

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Examples/SpectreConsole/Tutorials/InteractivePromptsTutorial.cs > InteractivePromptsTutorial.ChoosePizzaSize
```

Run it:

```bash
dotnet run
```

A list of pizza sizes appears with one highlighted. Use the up/down arrow keys to move between options, then press Enter to select.

The prompt handles all the keyboard interaction - no need to parse input or validate choices. Spectre.Console takes care of it.

An interactive menu with just a few lines of code.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
**Select Your Toppings**

What if the user wants to pick multiple items? That's where `MultiSelectionPrompt` comes in. Users can toggle items with the spacebar and confirm with Enter:

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Examples/SpectreConsole/Tutorials/InteractivePromptsTutorial.cs > InteractivePromptsTutorial.SelectToppings
```

Run it:

```bash
dotnet run
```

A list of toppings appears with checkboxes. Press Space to select or deselect items, use arrow keys to navigate, and press Enter when you're done.

The `NotRequired()` call allows zero items to be selected (for a plain cheese pizza). Without it, at least one selection would be required.

Your users can now make multiple selections.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
**Confirm the Order**

Before placing the order, let's ask for confirmation. The `Confirm()` method presents a simple yes/no question:

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Examples/SpectreConsole/Tutorials/InteractivePromptsTutorial.cs > InteractivePromptsTutorial.ConfirmOrder
```

Run it:

```bash
dotnet run
```

"Place this order? [y/n]" appears with options to type `y` or `n`. The method returns `true` for yes and `false` for no.

The `[y/n]` hint is automatically added - Spectre.Console handles common UX patterns for you.

Now you can get confirmation before important actions.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="5">
**Complete Pizza Order**

Let's put it all together into a complete ordering flow with a styled order summary:

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Examples/SpectreConsole/Tutorials/InteractivePromptsTutorial.cs > InteractivePromptsTutorial.Run
```

Run the complete application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The full ordering experience unfolds: enter your name, pick a size, select toppings, review the summary in a styled panel, and confirm your order.

We used a `Panel` to display the order summary - combining prompts with other Spectre.Console widgets creates polished, professional interfaces.

A complete interactive ordering flow.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Congratulations!

You've created a pizza ordering system that demonstrates all the core prompting features. Your application asks for text input, presents single-choice and multiple-choice menus, displays a styled summary, and confirms the order before processing.

Use these prompts in configuration wizards, CLI tools, installation scripts, and anywhere you need user input.
