Sometimes you need commands or options that work but shouldn't appear in help output—internal debugging tools, deprecated features you're phasing out, or advanced options that would overwhelm typical users. Hidden items remain fully functional; users who know about them can still use them.

## What We're Building

Notice `diagnostics` doesn't appear in help but still works when invoked directly. The `--skip-hooks` option on `deploy` is similarly hidden:

## Hide a Command

To hide a command from help output, chain `.IsHidden()` when configuring it:

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/HidingCommandsAndOptions/Main.cs > Demo.RunAsync
```

Running `--help` shows only `deploy` and `status`, but `diagnostics` still works when invoked directly.

## Hide an Option

For options, set `IsHidden = true` on the attribute:

```csharp:symbol
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/HidingCommandsAndOptions/Main.cs > DeployCommand.Settings
```

The `--skip-hooks` option won't appear in `deploy --help`, but users can still pass it.
