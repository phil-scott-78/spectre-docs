To test CLI applications, use `CommandAppTester` from `Spectre.Console.Cli.Testing`. It runs commands in-memory and captures exit codes and output for assertions.

## Make Commands Testable

Inject `IAnsiConsole` instead of using the static `AnsiConsole` directly. This allows tests to capture output:

```csharp:symbol
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/TestingCommands/Main.cs > GreetCommand
```

## Test with CommandAppTester

Install the testing package:

```bash
dotnet add package Spectre.Console.Cli.Testing
```

Configure the tester like a regular `CommandApp`, then call `Run` with arguments. The result provides `ExitCode`, `Output`, and `Settings` for assertions:

```csharp:symbol
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/TestingCommands/Main.cs > GreetCommandTests.Greet_WithName_ReturnsZeroAndOutputsGreeting
```

You can also verify that command-line arguments were parsed correctly:

```csharp:symbol
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/TestingCommands/Main.cs > GreetCommandTests.Greet_WithCount_ParsesSettingsCorrectly
```

## Test Interactive Prompts

For commands with prompts, use `TestConsole` to queue input before running:

```csharp:symbol
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/TestingCommands/Main.cs > InteractiveCommandTests.Interactive_WithQueuedInput_ProcessesCorrectly
```

Use `PushKey` for arrow keys and enter, `PushTextWithEnter` for text input.
