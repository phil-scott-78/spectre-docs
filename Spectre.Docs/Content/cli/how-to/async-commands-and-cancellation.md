When your command performs I/O-bound operations like HTTP requests, database queries, or file operations, use `AsyncCommand<TSettings>` instead of `Command<TSettings>`. This lets you use `async/await` and enables graceful shutdown when users press Ctrl+C.

## Wire Up Console Cancellation

To enable Ctrl+C handling, create a `CancellationTokenSource` and pass its token to `RunAsync`. The framework automatically propagates this token to your command's `ExecuteAsync` method.

```csharp:symbol,bodyonly
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/AsyncCommandsAndCancellation/Main.cs > Demo.RunAsync
```

## Create an Async Command

Inherit from `AsyncCommand<TSettings>` and override `ExecuteAsync`. The `CancellationToken` is passed automatically—forward it to any async operations so they can respond to cancellation requests.

```csharp:symbol
Spectre.Docs.Cli.Examples/DemoApps/AsyncCommandsAndCancellation/Main.cs > FetchCommand
```
